# simple-router

## What is this?

It is a small SPA powered by Vue. I made this using HTML5 History API, Bootstrap-Vue and my own router which
I made specially for this application to prepare myself for getting known Vue Router and Vuex. I didn't use
neither of them and this is why I had to use a lot of workarounds and everything is a bit messy but works!
